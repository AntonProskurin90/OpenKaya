This section includes only the sgf parser from the Gospeed board, open sourced for collaboration and improvements.

All improvements on the parser require working tests for them.

Pendings:

- Reformat indentation. This file uses tabs which is no longer current for the Kaya project. 4 spaces is the convention.

- Fix for sgfs that cant be loaded on gospeed.(Check the tweaki or the issue list on github to look for such links and games)

- Being able to read Kogo(currently cant) 

- Speed/performance benchmarks are welcome

- Load kogo on local storage : http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html
