Kaya Open source project.
====

Kaya will open source parts and bits of the application incrementally over time, until a stable development community is achieved.

Open-source code is subject to as rigorous standards as the server. Code must have decent unit test coverage, and well documented.

Dependencies & tools
====================

Current code is pure Javascript and can be run from within the browser without any installation.
